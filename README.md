# Greg Bell

Senior Technical Leader focused on Kubernetes-based distributed systems, workload isolation patterns, and AI-adjacent infrastructure operationalization in regulated enterprise environments.

---

## 🔎 Current Focus

- Kubernetes workload isolation & intelligent routing (light vs heavy patterns)
- Autoscaling strategy (HPA + resource governance)
- Kafka-based decoupled architectures
- Distributed system resilience & failure isolation
- Observability-driven scaling decisions
- Production-grade AI infrastructure patterns (inference & batch operationalization)

## 🚀 Flagship Work

### 🧠 Kubernetes Intelligent Workload Orchestrator
Reference architecture demonstrating:
- Kafka-based decoupling of mixed workloads
- Intelligent routing (light vs heavy classification)
- Independent worker pools with separate HPAs
- CPU-driven scaling under burst conditions
- Isolation to prevent cross-workload interference

### 📈 Memory Spike Predictor
Kubernetes-deployed scikit-learn sidecar forecasting memory usage for compute-intensive document workloads.  
Designed to prevent pod OOMKills and improve routing efficiency under burst conditions.

---

### 📦 Distributed Document Orchestrator
Production-grade orchestration framework featuring:
- Chunked large-file streaming (150MB+)
- SHA256 integrity validation
- SQL hex fallback extraction
- Exponential retry/backoff logic
- Corruption prevention under transient failures

---

## 🏗 Platform Engineering Highlights

- Operate Kubernetes (EKS) ecosystem supporting millions of API requests per day
- Process ~18K+ daily compute-intensive document transactions
- Tune pod CPU/memory requests & limits under constrained environments
- Implement service mesh resilience policies (Istio)
- Instrument workloads with Datadog & OpenTelemetry
- Modernize legacy integrations to event-driven architectures (Kafka-first patterns)

---

## 🎯 Leadership

- Lead architecture sessions with Deloitte GPS CTO leadership
- Translate business & compliance requirements into scalable platform designs
- Bridge executive strategy and distributed system implementation
- Mentor engineers in reliability, scaling, and cloud-native best practices
