# Greg Bell

Senior Technical Leader focused on Kubernetes-based distributed systems, workload isolation patterns, and AI-operationalized infrastructure in regulated enterprise environments.

I design systems that are:

- Scalable under burst load  
- Governed under compliance constraints  
- Deterministic under failure  
- AI-augmented without sacrificing control  

---

# 🔎 Current Focus

- Kubernetes workload isolation & intelligent routing (light vs heavy patterns)  
- Autoscaling strategy (HPA + resource governance)  
- Kafka-based decoupled architectures  
- Distributed system resilience & failure isolation  
- Observability-driven scaling decisions  
- Production-grade AI orchestration patterns (governed agent workflows)  
- Enterprise-safe AI operationalization (approval gates, policy guardrails, audit trails)  
- Multi-agent reasoning systems with deterministic aggregation logic

# 🚀 Flagship Work

## 📈 Stock-Agent: Multi-Agent Portfolio Governance Engine

Advanced multi-agent AI decision system that formalizes high-conviction, high-beta investing into a structured governance framework.

This project now functions as a conviction discipline engine — not just a scoring tool.

### 🧠 Multi-Agent Graph

Each position is evaluated by specialized agents:

- Thesis Integrity Agent  
- Risk Exposure Agent  
- Sentiment Agent  
- Skeptic (Adversarial) Agent  
- Bias Detection Agent  
- Consistency Agent  
- Judge Aggregation Agent  

These agents evaluate clarity, downside asymmetry, narrative alignment, structural fragility, bias, and allocation consistency.

### ⚖ Counterbalance Engine

Raw conviction is mathematically adjusted downward based on fragility signals.

Effective Buy Score:

EffBuy = Raw Buy − (Risk Weight × Risk + Skeptic Pressure + Agent Conflict)

This prevents conviction inflation and narrative overconfidence.

### 📊 Quant Overlay Layer

- Beta vs SPY  
- Annualized volatility  
- 12–1 momentum  
- Correlation clustering  
- HHI concentration analysis  
- Historical VaR & Expected Shortfall  
- Monte Carlo drawdown simulation  

Quant is used for structural awareness, not prediction.

### 🌎 Regime Detection (Blended Model)

- LLM-based macro narrative assessment  
- Quant-based SPY trend and volatility model  
- Confidence-threshold override logic  

Outputs: Risk-On / Neutral / Risk-Off

### 🔁 Persistent Conviction Memory

State tracking per ticker:

- Buy score drift  
- Risk escalation  
- Skeptic pressure changes  
- Score stability / jitter monitoring  

Conviction is tracked longitudinally — not evaluated in isolation.

### 📈 Portfolio Governance Features

- Allocation-aware scoring  
- Target max % enforcement  
- Structural sell-review triggers  
- Cash deployment recommendations  
- Stress testing (-20%, -30%, -40%)  
- Automated GitHub reporting  

Design philosophy:

- Sell when thesis breaks — not when volatility spikes  
- Allow asymmetric upside  
- Enforce structural downside discipline  
- Govern conviction, not predict price
