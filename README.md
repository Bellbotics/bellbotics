# Greg Bell

Senior Technical Leader focused on Kubernetes-based distributed systems, workload isolation patterns, and AI-operationalized infrastructure in regulated enterprise environments.

---

## 🔎 Current Focus

- Kubernetes workload isolation & intelligent routing (light vs heavy patterns)
- Autoscaling strategy (HPA + resource governance)
- Kafka-based decoupled architectures
- Distributed system resilience & failure isolation
- Observability-driven scaling decisions
- Production-grade AI orchestration patterns (governed agent workflows)
- Enterprise-safe AI operationalization (approval gates, policy guardrails, audit trails)

---

## 🚀 Flagship Work

### 🛡 Enterprise Ops Copilot (LangGraph)
Enterprise-grade AI orchestration framework demonstrating how LLM-driven workflows can be safely operationalized in regulated environments.

Key capabilities:
- Stateful, checkpointed LangGraph orchestration
- Human-in-the-loop approval gates (separation of duties)
- Policy-as-code enforcement (environment rules, risk controls, redaction)
- Artifact-driven change generation (PR diffs, ticket payloads, Slack updates)
- Persistent audit trails & resumable execution
- Portable adapters (Kubernetes, APM, DB signals, Git, ITSM)

Designed to demonstrate how AI can augment incident response without violating governance or compliance constraints.

### 🧠 Kubernetes Intelligent Workload Orchestrator
Reference architecture demonstrating:
- Kafka-based decoupling of mixed workloads
- Intelligent routing (light vs heavy classification)
- Independent worker pools with separate HPAs
- CPU-driven scaling under burst conditions
- Isolation to prevent cross-workload interference

Repo: https://github.com/Bellbotics/k8s-intelligent-workload-orchestrator

---

### 📈 Memory Spike Predictor
Kubernetes-deployed scikit-learn sidecar forecasting memory usage for compute-intensive document workloads.  
Designed to prevent pod OOMKills and improve routing efficiency under burst conditions.

---

### 📊 Streaming Analytics Demo (Apache Flink)
Simulated usage-based billing and streaming analytics pipeline using Apache Flink to demonstrate:
- Real-time event processing
- Stateful stream operations
- Throughput and latency tuning
- Event-time windowing & checkpointing

Repo: https://github.com/Bellbotics/flink-streaming-analytics-demo

---

### 📦 Distributed Document Orchestrator
Production-grade orchestration framework featuring:
- Chunked large-file streaming (150MB+)
- SHA256 integrity validation
- SQL hex fallback extraction
- Exponential retry/backoff logic
- Corruption prevention under transient failures
- Resilient Kubernetes-based execution under memory constraints

---

## 🏗 Platform Engineering Highlights

- Operate Kubernetes (EKS) ecosystem supporting millions of API requests per day
- Process ~18K+ daily compute-intensive document transactions
- Tune pod CPU/memory requests & limits under constrained environments
- Implement service mesh resilience policies (Istio)
- Instrument workloads with Datadog & OpenTelemetry
- Modernize legacy integrations to event-driven architectures (Kafka-first patterns)
- Design governance-first AI orchestration systems for enterprise production environments

---

## 🎯 Leadership

- Lead architecture sessions with Deloitte GPS CTO leadership
- Translate business & compliance requirements into scalable platform designs
- Bridge executive strategy and distributed system implementation
- Mentor engineers in reliability, scaling, AI safety, and cloud-native best practices
- Drive modernization initiatives toward event-driven and AI-augmented operational models
