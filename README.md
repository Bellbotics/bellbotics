# Greg Bell

Senior Technical Leader focused on Kubernetes-based distributed systems, workload isolation patterns, and AI-operationalized infrastructure in regulated enterprise environments.

I design systems that are:
- Scalable under burst load
- Governed under compliance constraints
- Deterministic under failure
- AI-augmented without sacrificing control

---

# 🔎 Current Focus

- Kubernetes workload isolation & intelligent routing (light vs heavy patterns)
- Autoscaling strategy (HPA + resource governance)
- Kafka-based decoupled architectures
- Distributed system resilience & failure isolation
- Observability-driven scaling decisions
- Production-grade AI orchestration patterns (governed agent workflows)
- Enterprise-safe AI operationalization (approval gates, policy guardrails, audit trails)

# 🚀 Flagship Work

## 📈 Stock-Agent: Multi-Agent LLM Portfolio Engine

Personal multi-agent LLM decision framework designed to systematize high-conviction, high-beta equity investing.

This project demonstrates how structured AI orchestration patterns can be applied beyond enterprise operations — into capital allocation systems.

Core capabilities:

- Multi-agent evaluation (Thesis, Risk, Sentiment, Bias, Judge)
- Market regime detection (risk_on / neutral / risk_off)
- Deterministic scoring (Buy Score, Hold Confidence, Sell Risk)
- Allocation-aware cash deployment recommendations
- Automatic portfolio % calculation
- Stress testing (-20%, -30%, -40% scenarios)
- GitHub Actions automated reporting
- YAML-driven portfolio configuration

Design philosophy:

- Sell only when thesis breaks — not on volatility
- Conviction-weighted scoring
- Regime-adjusted aggressiveness
- Structured reasoning over prediction

## 🛡 Enterprise Ops Copilot (LangGraph)

Enterprise-grade AI orchestration framework demonstrating how LLM-driven workflows can be safely operationalized in regulated environments.

Key capabilities:

- Stateful, checkpointed LangGraph orchestration
- Human-in-the-loop approval gates (separation of duties)
- Policy-as-code enforcement (environment rules, risk controls, redaction)
- Artifact-driven change generation (PR diffs, ticket payloads, Slack updates)
- Persistent audit trails & resumable execution
- Portable adapters (Kubernetes, APM, DB signals, Git, ITSM)

Designed to demonstrate how AI can augment incident response without violating governance or compliance constraints.

## 🧠 Kubernetes Intelligent Workload Orchestrator

Reference architecture demonstrating:

- Kafka-based decoupling of mixed workloads
- Intelligent routing (light vs heavy classification)
- Independent worker pools with separate HPAs
- CPU-driven scaling under burst conditions
- Isolation to prevent cross-workload interference

Repo: https://github.com/Bellbotics/k8s-intelligent-workload-orchestrator

---

## 📈 Memory Spike Predictor

Kubernetes-deployed scikit-learn sidecar forecasting memory usage for compute-intensive document workloads.

Designed to prevent pod OOMKills and improve routing efficiency under burst conditions.

Repo: https://github.com/Bellbotics/memory-spike-predictor

---

## 📊 Streaming Analytics Demo (Apache Flink)

Simulated usage-based billing and streaming analytics pipeline using Apache Flink to demonstrate:

- Real-time event processing
- Stateful stream operations
- Throughput and latency tuning
- Event-time windowing & checkpointing

Repo: https://github.com/Bellbotics/flink-streaming-analytics-demo

---

## 📦 Distributed Document Orchestrator

Production-grade orchestration framework featuring:

- Chunked large-file streaming (150MB+)
- SHA256 integrity validation
- SQL hex fallback extraction
- Exponential retry/backoff logic
- Corruption prevention under transient failures
- Resilient Kubernetes-based execution under memory constraints

---

# 🏗 Platform Engineering Highlights

- Operate Kubernetes (EKS) ecosystems supporting millions of API requests per day
- Process ~18K+ daily compute-intensive document transactions
- Tune pod CPU/memory requests & limits under constrained environments
- Implement service mesh resilience policies (Istio)
- Instrument workloads with Datadog & OpenTelemetry
- Modernize legacy integrations to event-driven architectures (Kafka-first patterns)
- Design governance-first AI orchestration systems for enterprise production environments

---

# 🧠 Technical Themes Across Projects

Across both enterprise and personal systems, consistent patterns emerge:

- Multi-agent orchestration
- Deterministic workflow control
- Isolation between workload classes
- Policy-aware execution
- Observability-first design
- Failure-resilient infrastructure
- Capital and compute treated as allocatable resources

The same architectural discipline applies to:

Incident response  
Document processing  
AI orchestration  
Capital allocation
