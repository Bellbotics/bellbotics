# Professional Experience

## Deloitte — Product Delivery Manager  
**VA Lighthouse Platform (Federal Program)**  
2021–Present  

Lead technical architecture and Kubernetes-based platform engineering for mission-critical federal systems processing ~100K+ daily compute-intensive document transactions (150MB+, 1000+ pages) under strict container memory constraints.

### Kubernetes & Platform Engineering

- Architect and operate Kubernetes (EKS) microservice ecosystem with 6GB pod memory limits under burst workload conditions  
- Tune HPA scaling thresholds and container resource requests/limits to prevent OOMKills and optimize horizontal scaling  
- Implement workload isolation patterns for compute-heavy PDF watermarking and compression services  
- Leverage Istio service mesh for traffic control, retry policies, and resilience governance  
- Manage GitOps deployments via ArgoCD to support controlled scaling and rollout strategies  

### Intelligent Workload Optimization

- Developed ML-based memory spike prediction sidecar (scikit-learn) deployed alongside Kubernetes workloads to classify high-memory transactions prior to scheduling  
- Reduced memory-related failures through predictive routing and JVM heap tuning (Java 21, G1GC optimization)  
- Engineered resilient chunked streaming pipeline including:
  - SQL hex-based fallback extraction  
  - SHA256 checksum validation  
  - Exponential retry/backoff logic  
  - Timeout-enforced distributed recovery  
- Eliminated truncated file corruption via per-chunk orchestration across distributed pods  

### Observability & Reliability

- Instrumented Kubernetes workloads using Datadog and OpenTelemetry for pod-level memory/CPU anomaly detection  
- Established resilience standards including circuit breakers, bulkheads, and autoscaling governance patterns  
- Analyzed workload burst behavior to inform scaling and infrastructure tuning decisions  

### Architecture & Executive Leadership

- Lead architecture sessions with Deloitte GPS CTO leadership  
- Facilitate customer-facing discussions translating business and compliance requirements into scalable Kubernetes-based technical designs  
- Contribute to modernization strategy migrating SOAP-based MPI integrations toward REST/event-driven patterns  
- Proposed Kafka-based enterprise event backbone to improve decoupling and scalability  
- Mentor 15+ engineers in distributed systems design and cloud-native reliability
